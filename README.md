This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError that can occur when calculating averages.  The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version that handles empty input lists appropriately.  The error occurs when the input list is empty, leading to division by zero. The solution adds a check for an empty list and returns 0 to avoid the error.
